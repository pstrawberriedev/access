      <h1>Access</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        An accessibility endeavor focusing on the four outlined areas of disability affecting web use: <span>visual</span>, <span>hearing</span>, <span>motor</span>, and <span>cognitive</span>.
      </p>

      <p>This project's purpose is to spread awareness of accessibility concerns regarding internet use by disabled individuals, as well as to provide a condensed source of information that helps in bringing web sites as close in adherance as possible to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2 compliance</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Access is a tool to educate oneself about accessible HTML application &amp; technique. By laying out our markup with accessibility as a guide, we positively affect other areas of front-end development and broaden our view of the web as a whole.
