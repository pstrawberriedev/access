A venture into the world of front-end accessibility

## An exploration of accessible HTML, CSS, and JS

Access is a personal starting point from which to dive into the world of accessibility. Accessibility seems extremely daunting, and the documentation, while readily available, is very confusing to try and take in all at once. This project aims to wire up common components of web sites with accessibility as the first (and pretty much only, as far as the scope of this project is concerned) order of business.

Access is mean to be:

- A tool to help in the learning of front-end accessibility
- A tool to understand how screen readers (currently only tested on NVDA) handle web pages
